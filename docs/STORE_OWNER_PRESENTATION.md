## **Why ToyBox vs. Other Options?**

### **vs. Facebook/Instagram Only:**
- ❌ Facebook: Posts get buried, hard to find specific toys
- ✅ ToyBox: All products organized, searchable, always accessible

### **vs. Marketplace Apps (Jumia, Jiji, etc.):**
- ❌ Marketplaces: Pay commission (10-20% per sale)
- ❌ Marketplaces: They own customer relationships
- ❌ Marketplaces: Complicated shipping/payment rules
- ✅ ToyBox: **Zero commission**, you keep 100% of sales
- ✅ ToyBox: Direct WhatsApp contact with customers
- ✅ ToyBox: You control everything

### **vs. WhatsApp Only:**
- ❌ WhatsApp catalog: Limited to 500 items, hard to manage
- ❌ WhatsApp: Customers must save your number first
- ✅ ToyBox: Unlimited products
- ✅ ToyBox: Anyone can browse without saving your number
